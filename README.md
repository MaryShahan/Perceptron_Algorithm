# Perceptron_Algorithm

Perceptron is single node in an artificial neural network ðŸ¤–
It's an an algorithm (a set of instructions) ðŸ“ƒ that's meant to mimic a neuron inside a human brain! 

In machine learning, the perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. 
A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class. It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector.
